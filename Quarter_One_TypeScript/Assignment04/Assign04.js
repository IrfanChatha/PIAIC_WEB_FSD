//  - Write a program that checks if the given year is leap year or not.
//  - Develop a program that determines the day of the week. Ask the user for a number (1-7) and use nested if statements to print the corresponding day's name.
//  - Write a program that takes the number of units consumed by a user if it is greater than 100 then add 10% tax if greater than 200 then add 15% of tax so on up to if greater than 500 then add 25% of tax
//    Where the tax amount will be calculated by the amount of bill.
