**Expense Page**

The expense page is the main page of the application. It allows users to add, edit, and delete expenses, and provides a summary of their spending.

The expense page is implemented using the `Expenses` component. The `Expenses` component is a React functional component that uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the expenses. The `Expenses` component also uses the `useEffect` hook to fetch the expenses from the server when the component is mounted.

The `Expenses` component is composed of the following subcomponents:

* `ExpenseForm`: This component allows users to add a new expense.
* `ExpenseList`: This component displays a list of the expenses.
* `ExpenseSummary`: This component provides a summary of the expenses.

**Expense Form**

The expense form is implemented using the `ExpenseForm` component. The `ExpenseForm` component is a React functional component that uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the form. The `ExpenseForm` component also uses the `useEffect` hook to submit the form data to the server when the form is submitted.

The `ExpenseForm` component is composed of the following subcomponents:

* `TextField`: This component allows users to enter the name of the expense.
* `NumberField`: This component allows users to enter the amount.
